# redesigned-infection-simulator
This is a redesign of an infection simulator that I created in UNCG, it aims to have more feature and be faster.

Gaols of this project
  1. Redesign the simulator to be quicker than the orginal
  2. Move from java to c/c++(not decided)
  3. ensure that it is more scable than its predecessor
  4. Add large amount of features and make the assignment of variables more user friendly
